# Luigi's Mansion Blender Toolkit

This project aims to make a majority of Luigi's Mansion model formats importable and exportable from blender and give more granular control
over models output. Please note that the imported models will not look perfect as there are some things the game does that blender does not do, such as wrap modes for textures.

## Known Issues
- Some anm animations import incorrectly
- PTH exports lack smoothing data
- Normals may sometimes be broken, play with them a bit

## Roadmap Progress
- [x] Bin Model Import/Export
- [x] ANM Animation Import/Export
- [x] CMN Import/Export
- [X] PTH Import/Export
- [ ] COL.MP Import/Export
- [ ] MDL Import/Export?
